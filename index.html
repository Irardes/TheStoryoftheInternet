            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>The Story of the Internet takes readers on a journey through the fascinating evolution of the internet, a global network that has transformed how we communicate, work, and interact. Starting in the early days of the Cold War, the book delves into the pivotal event of the 1950s—the launch of Sputnik by the Soviet Union—which ignited the technological rivalry between the United States and the USSR. This sparked the creation of early computer networks and set the stage for the development of technologies that would eventually lead to the internet as we know it.</p>
            <p>Through the decades, Stephen Bryant expertly chronicles the milestones that marked the internet's rise: from the formation of ARPANET, the first large-scale computer network funded by the U.S. Department of Defense, to the creation of TCP/IP, the protocol that became the foundation of the modern internet. The author also highlights the breakthroughs of the 1990s, including the development of the World Wide Web by Tim Berners-Lee and the birth of web browsers, which allowed ordinary people to navigate the internet with ease.</p>
            <p>The book details the boom of early internet companies like Netscape and Yahoo!, who pioneered the commercial use of the internet, and the subsequent dotcom bubble that reshaped the technology industry. However, it also touches on the downfall of many of these companies, illustrating the risks and rewards of investing in rapidly advancing technologies. As the internet expanded, so did its impact on culture, business, and society, bringing new opportunities but also challenges, from privacy concerns to the rapid spread of misinformation.</p>
            <p>In the 21st century, the internet's evolution continued with the rise of social media, online shopping, streaming services, and the gig economy, which fundamentally changed how we live, work, and consume. Bryant also examines the profound role the internet played in shaping global politics, from online activism to the rise of fake news and cyberattacks. As we look ahead, the book explores the future of the internet, including the possibilities and challenges of artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and the growing debate over digital privacy and regulation.</p>
            <p>Ultimately, The Story of the Internet not only traces the technological milestones of this digital revolution but also provides a thoughtful exploration of its societal implications. The book prompts readers to consider how the internet has reshaped the world and what it might mean for the future of humanity.</p>
